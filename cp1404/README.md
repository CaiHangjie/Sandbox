# CP1404 Practice Repository README

## About this Repository

This repository is a thorough compilation of the practice problems and programming exercises I have meticulously worked through along my educational journey. These tasks include a wide range of programming languages and ideas, all purposefully created to improve my coding skills and expand my knowledge of foundational ideas. I aim to establish a strong foundation in software .

## Personal Introduction

My name is Cai Hangjie, and I am a proactive learner and developer who enjoys trying different programming languages. I will try to learn new skills and information to become a better programmer.

## Key Lessons Learned on Clean Code

Here are three major lessons I've learned regarding "clean code":

1. **Clarity in Naming**: Understanding how to choose meaningful variable names, function names, and class names to make code more understandable and maintainable.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Learning to write functions and methods that are responsible for only one task, enhancing code modularity and testability.
3. **Code Refactoring**:  Mastering techniques to enhance code readability, performance, and maintainability
