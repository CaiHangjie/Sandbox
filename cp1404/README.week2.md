# Week 2 - Overview of CMSs

## Weeks: Week 2

### Learning activities:

* The first obstacle encountered was the difficulty of installing Joomla. Although following the installation guide provided by Joomla's official website, several errors still occurred. This includes compatibility issues with the server environment and difficulties in setting up databases. These technical issues result in spending a lot of time troubleshooting rather than completing actual tasks.
* Even if the installation issue is resolved, accessing the Joomla backend remains difficult. CMS often fails to load, display server errors, or times out. These issues make it almost impossible to perform basic tasks such as configuration settings, adding content, or installing templates and extensions.
* Joomla's learning curve is very steep, especially for beginners in content management systems. Understanding its complex interface, numerous settings, and various components requires more time than expected. This complexity increases frustration and hinders the progress of the task.

## Estimated Hours: 30 hours

## Content insights:
* Although Joomla provides a large amount of documentation, it is very difficult to find specific solutions to the problems encountered. Community forums provide some help, but replies are often delayed, which slows down the speed of problem-solving. The lack of immediate technical support further exacerbates the difficulties.
* After several days of struggle with Joomla, it is clear that continuing to use CMS within the mission deadline is not feasible. I have decided to use HTML and CSS to complete this week's homework first, and then ask my classmates after class.

## Next Step
1. Solve Joomla installation and accessibility issues
2. To continue using Joomla to complete assignments, it is crucial to address the installation and accessibility issues encountered earlier
3. Explore Joomla extensions: Research and install relevant extensions that can enhance website functionality. Content management, SEO, and design extensions can significantly improve the functionality and appearance of a website.
4. Follow Joomla Tutorial: Use tutorials and guides designed specifically for Joomla to learn how to effectively use its interface, manage content, and customize websites. These resources can provide step-by-step instructions and tips to simplify the development process.
