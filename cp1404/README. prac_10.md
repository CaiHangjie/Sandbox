## The accuracy of actual task estimation
At the beginning, I found that the estimated time for my task was not accurate. The unfamiliarity with the details of the problem and language barriers led to some errors, which often required me to complete the task longer than originally expected. Over time, I have indeed made progress, but there is still a certain degree of inaccuracy. In the process of completing the code, I often encounter some problems that I find difficult to solve on my own and need to seek help from others. This process not only consumes time, but also affects the progress of the task. Through experience and feedback, I have learned to better estimate the time and resources required for tasks. I realized that various uncertainty factors need to be taken into account in the estimation process, and learned to evaluate the complexity and difficulty of tasks more cautiously.

## Code reviews
Through code review, I not only learned how to write cleaner and more maintainable code, but also gained a deeper understanding of various best practices and design patterns. Reviewing someone else's code has made me more acutely aware of potential issues and opportunities for improvement, thereby improving the quality of the code.

## Practical tasks 
If I were responsible for this topic, I would focus on improving my own workflow. I will analyze the task requirements more carefully and ensure that I fully understand and master every detail. In addition, I will strengthen my technical ability cultivation, continuously learn and improve to cope with various challenges and difficulties that may arise in the task. I will also seek support from the community and online resources to quickly obtain help and solutions when encountering difficulties. I believe that by continuously improving my personal abilities and self-management, I can better complete tasks and achieve success.


## Code comment review
